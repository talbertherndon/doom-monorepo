"This video demonstrates how a 290-square-foot studio apartment was transformed in three days, primarily using items found on Facebook Marketplace. This process begins by selling the apartment owner's old belongings to generate funds. Some significant purchases included a mid-century dresser for $300 and a rug. The project incorporated DIY elements, such as creating a queen-sized headboard from plywood, and reupholstering furniture with fabric purchased from a fabric store. A bed frame from Facebook Marketplace was acquired for $100, and the headboard was mounted to it using brackets and wood.
